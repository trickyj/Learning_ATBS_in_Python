Lesson 3

Write our first program
*****************************************
Function = Mini-Program in the program
*****************************************
Values passed to the functions = Arguments

The len() Function 

What len() does is - It takes the String argumet and then evalutes to the integer value of the length of the string.
*****************************************
The str(), int(), and floa() Functions
*****************************************
Example -  this is how the program works.

#first the (myAge) variable  will evaluate to the value which is inside it.

print (' you will be ' + str(int(myAge) + 1) + 'in a year.')

# Then that gets passed to the int() function, wich returns an integer form of it 
print('you will be ' + str(int('26') +1 )+ 'in a year.')

#Then we add 1 to that integer.

print('you will be' + str(26 + 1 ) + 'in a year.')

# Then we had to convert that back to a string value, because we want to concatenate the other streets next to it. 

print('you will be ' + str( 27 ) + 'in a year.')

# note '' value inside single quote is string. and then it is just a string concatenate.

print ('you will be ' + '27' + 'in a year.')


print ('you will be 27 in a year.')

*****************************************

Example of a program - 

It ask for your name
It will then count the length of the name
It will then ask for your age
It will then add 1 and will show you how old you are next year. 

*****************************************

# This program says hello and asks for your name

print('Hello World')

print('What is your name?') # ask for their name

myName  = input() #myName is a Function and Intput() lets user type in value.

print('It is good to meet you, ' + myName)

print ('The lenght of your name is: ')
print(len(myName)) 

#len() is a function What #len() does is - It takes the String argumet #and then evalutes to the integer value of #the length of the string.

print('What is your age?') #ask for thier age.

myAge = input() # myAge is a function and input() let users type in value.

print('you will be ' + str(int(myAge)+ 1) + ' in a year.')

Recap : 

- The programs into the file editor
- The eecution starts at the top and moves down
- # comments are ingnored by Python
- Functions are mini-programs in your program
- print() displayes the value passed to it
- input() lets user tyoe in a value
- len() takes a string value and retuns an integer value of the string's length.
- int(), str(), and float() converts values' data type
